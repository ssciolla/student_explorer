        <h2 class="header">About Student Explorer</h2>
        <p>Student Explorer is an early warning system that leverages Learning Management System data to <b>help
            academic advisors identify at-risk students.</b> It uses learning analytics techniques to create actionable
            intelligence that assists academic advisors in identifying students at risk of academic jeopardy in order to
            facilitate outreach to these students. The tool helps advisors create timely interventions to direct
            students toward resources or behavioral changes that help facilitate future student success. Student
            Explorer is available to all academic advisors at the U-M Ann Arbor campus upon request for access and
            includes information about all students on the Ann Arbor campus, including graduate students. For more
            information about how Student Explorer works and how to use it, please refer to the
            <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/831">Student Explorer documentation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="header">About Cohorts</h2>
        <p>Student Explorer operates using a cohort model; students are assigned to advisors using cohorts so that
            advisors can see all of their students in their "My Students" tab. <b>You do not need to have cohorts in
            order to use Student Explorer</b> &#151; you can search for students individually using the search bar in
            the upper right, or navigate to an individual student's page using the link under "Term Progress" in the LSA
            Undergraduate Student Advising File. However, if you would like to set up a cohort to see all of your
            students in one list, please follow the instructions in the
            <a href="https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/831">Student Explorer documentation</a>. <b>Cohorts are
            not connected to advisor assignments in Wolverine Access or the LSA Undergraduate Student Advising
            File.</b>
        </p>

        <h2 class="header">Student Explorer History</h2>
        <p>Student Explorer was started as a research project in 2011 led by Professor Stephanie Teasley and Dr. Steven
            Lonn in partnership with M-STEM Academies. LSA Technology Services, Academic Innovation, and ITS Teaching &
            Learning have contributed to the design, development, and management of the tool. Student Explorer is
            currently run by ITS Teaching & Learning, and questions and comments can be directed to the team by
